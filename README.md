### This set of data is about threatened species over time periods from 2000 to 2022. There are in total of 4 major groups: Vertebrates, Invertebrates, Plants, and Fungi and Protists; 29 vairbles, and 22 of them are the specific species. This data basically took the total assessed of these species and observe the number of threatened ones.

### The About page: a brief introduction of the project, dataset, and a visual look of a few random samples.

### The Plot page: this page shows a widget on the left that tells the audience to choose one of the species they are interested in, and the total number of assessed and threatend species will show on the line plot to the right depending on which species they choose on the widget. This plot helps audience to have a better visualization and show a clear trend of overall threatened species are increasing throughout the time. The "Select a palette" is basically another option of the color of the plot. Below the plot, there is a calculation about the average number of threatened species from 2000 to 2022. The result will varied based on what species you chose on the widget.

### The Table page: This page tells you what each specific species fall under which of the four major groups. Once the audience select a major group, all the data about the species falling under this group will appear as a table to the right. Above the table, there is also a calculation of increased total threatened species of your choice from 2000 to 2022.
